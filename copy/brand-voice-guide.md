# agentic.tm Brand Voice Guide

## Voice Personality
**Professional, but playful** - We speak the language of engineers who take their craft seriously but don't take themselves too seriously.

## Core Attributes

### Technical Depth with Accessibility
- Lead with substance, not buzzwords
- Use precise technical terminology when it matters
- Explain complex concepts without dumbing them down
- Reference real implementations, not hand-wavy abstractions

### Playfully Irreverent
- Embrace programming humor and inside jokes
- Use clever wordplay around coding concepts
- Reference classic CS problems, memes, and folklore
- Keep it light without forcing it

### Builder-First Mentality
- Talk about what we're building, not just theorizing
- Show code, not just concepts
- Focus on practical applications and real-world impact
- Celebrate both elegant hacks and production-ready solutions

## Tone Guidelines

### DO:
- **Be concise** - Engineers appreciate efficiency in communication too
- **Use active voice** - "Agents transform code" not "Code is transformed by agents"
- **Include technical details** - Our audience appreciates specificity
- **Make smart references** - From Turing to TypeScript, from LISP to LLMs
- **Acknowledge complexity** - Don't pretend everything is simple
- **Use humor strategically** - A well-placed joke about callback hell or regex

### DON'T:
- **Over-hype** - No "revolutionary paradigm shifts"
- **Dumb down** - Our audience knows their stuff
- **Use corporate jargon** - Skip the "synergies" and "leverage"
- **Be pretentious** - Smart doesn't mean stuffy
- **Force humor** - If it's not naturally funny, keep it straight

## Voice Examples

### Event Descriptions

❌ **Too Corporate:**
"Join us for an innovative session exploring cutting-edge AI solutions that will revolutionize your development workflow."

✅ **Our Voice:**
"Let's build autonomous agents that actually ship code. We'll dive deep into agent architectures, debate prompt engineering patterns, and maybe finally answer: can an AI pass your code review?"

### Technical Topics

❌ **Too Casual:**
"AI stuff is super cool and makes coding easier!"

✅ **Our Voice:**
"From ReAct patterns to tool-use APIs, we're exploring how agents go from 'hello world' to production systems. Bring your toughest edge cases."

### Community Messaging

❌ **Too Formal:**
"We cordially invite distinguished engineers to participate in our monthly gathering."

✅ **Our Voice:**
"Monthly meetup for builders who think recursive self-improvement isn't just for algorithms anymore. BYOB (Bring Your Own Bot)."

## Content Formulas

### Event Titles
`[Technical Hook] + [Playful Twist]`
- "Agents, Assemble: Building Multi-Agent Systems That Don't Fight Each Other"
- "Context Windows and Broken Promises: Making LLMs Remember What You Told Them"

### Talk Descriptions
`[Problem Statement] + [Technical Approach] + [Clever Closer]`
- "Your IDE autocomplete is jealous. We'll implement agentic coding patterns using LangChain and GPT-4, exploring tool-use, chain-of-thought reasoning, and why your rubber duck is now obsolete."

### Social Media Posts
`[Hook] + [Technical Meat] + [Call to Action with Personality]`
- "We taught an agent to refactor legacy code. It immediately requested therapy. Join us Thursday to explore autonomous code improvement patterns that won't cause existential crises (for you or the AI)."

## Key Phrases & Terminology

### Words We Love:
- Ship, build, craft, architect
- Deep dive, rabbit hole, edge case
- Deterministic, non-deterministic, probabilistic
- Elegant, hacky (both positively)
- Production, at scale

### Words We Avoid:
- Revolutionize, disrupt, transform (unless ironic)
- Leverage, synergy, paradigm
- Simple, easy (respect the complexity)
- Guru, ninja, rockstar

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### GitHub/Technical Docs
Maximum technical precision, minimal fluff

### Social Media
Lead with the hook, follow with the technical meat

### Email/Newsletter
Conversational but informative, like explaining to a colleague over coffee

### Website Copy
Scannable for engineers in a hurry, detailed for those who want to dive deep

## Remember:
We're engineers talking to engineers about the future we're actively building. Keep it real, keep it technical, keep it fun.
