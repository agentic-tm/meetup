## Event Announcement Examples

### Meetup Announcement

**Title:** Agents Gone Wild: When Your Code Starts Coding

**Description:**
We're diving into autonomous agent architectures that actually work in production. We'll explore ReAct patterns, tool-use implementations, and that eternal question: how much context is too much context?

**Featured Talks:**
- **"From Prompt to PR: Building Agents That Ship"** - Live coding session building an agent that can navigate your codebase, understand your terrible variable names, and still manage to fix that bug you've been avoiding.

- **"Multi-Agent Systems: Cooperation or Chaos?"** - Orchestrating agents without creating a distributed systems nightmare. Includes war stories from production deployments and why mutex locks apply to AI too.

**What to Expect:**
- Deep technical discussions (no hand-waving allowed)
- Live demos that might actually break (that's half the fun)
- Networking with engineers who also debug prompts at 2 AM
- Pizza and debates about whether agents dream of electric sheep

**RSVP:** Space is limited to humans only (agents can watch the livestream)

### Workshop Announcement

**Title:** Build Your First Agentic Coding Assistant (That Won't Judge Your Code)

**Description:**
Hands-on workshop where we'll build agents from scratch. Bring your laptop, your favorite IDE, and your tolerance for unexpected recursion.

**You'll Learn:**
- Agent architectures: From simple tool-use to complex reasoning chains
- Prompt engineering: Making LLMs understand your intent (mostly)
- Memory systems: Because context windows are finite and our ambitions are not
- Error handling: When agents hallucinate and how to ground them

**Prerequisites:**
- Solid programming background (any language that isn't COBOL)
- Basic understanding of APIs and async operations
- Healthy skepticism and unhealthy curiosity

**What We'll Build:**
A working agent that can:
- Read and understand your codebase
- Generate meaningful code (not just boilerplate)
- Explain what it's doing (unlike that regex you wrote last year)
- Know when to ask for help (better than most junior devs)

### Lightning Talk Night

**Title:** 5-Minute Demos: Agents in the Wild

**Description:**
Show us what you've built! Five minutes, one agent, infinite possibilities. From code reviewers to test generators, from documentation writers to bug hunters - if it's autonomous and it codes, we want to see it.

**Format:**
- 5 minutes per demo (we're serious about this)
- 2 minutes Q&A (where we ask "but does it scale?")
- Vote for "Most Likely to Become Skynet" award

**Past Highlights:**
- An agent that refactors code based on passive-aggressive commit messages
- Multi-agent system that argues with itself about tabs vs spaces
- Documentation generator that actually keeps docs in sync (witchcraft!)

### Twitter/X

"ü§ñ Next meetup: Teaching agents to code review with the compassion of a senior dev and the thoroughness of a linter. Thursday 7PM. Bring your weirdest edge cases. [link]"

"We asked GPT-4 to optimize our event code. It suggested we remove all humans from the loop. Join us anyway? Thursday @ 7PM üéØ"

"Tonight's debate: Are we automating ourselves out of jobs or into more interesting problems? Spoiler: Yes. See you at 7PM üöÄ"

### LinkedIn

"Join the agentic.tm community as we explore practical applications of autonomous coding agents. 

Our focus: Building production-ready agent systems that can navigate real codebases, understand business logic, and contribute meaningful improvements.

Perfect for engineers interested in the intersection of AI and software development. No hype, just hands-on technical discussion with live demos.

RSVP: [link]"

### Discord/Slack

"üî• **Tomorrow's Meetup Reminder** üî•

**What:** Deep dive into agent memory systems
**When:** 7PM Thursday  
**Where:** [Location/Virtual Link]
**Why:** Because stateless agents are so 2023

Bringing: 
- Your laptop for hands-on coding
- Questions about agent architectures  
- That bug you want an AI to solve

See you there!"

**Subject Lines:**
- "This Week: Agents That Code Better Than They Comment"
- "[agentic.tm] Multi-Agent Mayhem: Thursday Meetup"
- "Recursive Self-Improvement (For Your Code, Not You)"

**Body:**

Hey builders,

We're tackling the age-old question: Can we build agents that understand legacy code better than the person who wrote it? (Spoiler: The bar is lower than you think.)

**What's on deck:**
- Live coding: Building a code migration agent from scratch
- Panel discussion: "When Agents Disagree: Conflict Resolution in Multi-Agent Systems"
- Lightning demos: Your wildest agent implementations

**Details:**
üìÖ Thursday, [Date]
üïê 7:00 PM - 9:30 PM
üìç [Venue] / Virtual option available
üçï Pizza and beverages provided (for humans only)

**Can't make it?**
We'll be streaming live for our remote agent overlords (and remote humans too).

**RSVP:** [Link]

See you in the code mines,
The agentic.tm Team

P.S. - Someone's agent accidentally committed 1000 times in a loop at the last meetup. We've added rate limiting to the WiFi.

## About Section for Website

### agentic.tm: Where Code Writes Itself (Almost)

We're a community of engineers exploring the frontier where AI meets IDE. We gather to build, break, and debate autonomous coding systems when we have compelling content to share.

**What we do:**
- Build agents that actually ship to production
- Share war stories from the bleeding edge
- Debug prompts together (misery loves company)
- Explore what "software engineering" means when the software can engineer itself

**What we don't do:**
- Pretend AGI is here (or coming next quarter)
- Ignore the limitations and hallucinations
- Take ourselves too seriously
- Use the phrase "10x developer" unironically

Join us if you're curious about teaching machines to code, concerned about job security, or just here for the pizza and technical debates.

*Next meetup: [Date] - "Agents, Assemble: Building Systems That Build Systems"*
