## Event Name
agentic.tm #1: Cursor, Claude, and the Art of Letting AI Write Your Code

## Event Description

### 🤖 THE FIRST AGENTIC.TM MEETUP IS HERE

Are you letting AI agents write your code? Using Cursor like it's 2025? Having philosophical debates with Claude about variable naming? Perfect - you've found your people.

Join us on **Thursday, August 28th at 18:30** at CoworkGarden Timisoara for the inaugural agentic.tm meetup, where we'll learn from experienced practitioners and share real experiences from the trenches of AI-assisted development.

Ever watched Claude refactor your entire codebase while you grab coffee? Spent hours crafting the perfect Cursor prompt only to get schooled by autocomplete? This is your tribe.

### Featured Speakers

**🎤 Alexandru Binzar (CEO @ Hibyte)**
"How to Never Write Code Again with Cursor"

Alexandru will demonstrate how to configure Cursor so effectively that you can build entire features without writing code. Expect a complete walkthrough from setup to advanced context management, with live examples of turning ideas into working code through conversation alone.

**🎤 Vlad Temian (Tech Lead @ The Sandbox)**
"State of the Agentic Coding Ecosystem"

Vlad will map out the current agentic coding landscape, comparing tools like Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, and Copilot. Learn which tool fits which use case, integration patterns that work in production, and where the ecosystem is heading in the next 6 months.
