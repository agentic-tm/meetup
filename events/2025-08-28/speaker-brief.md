# Speaker & Presenter Brief - agentic.tm Meetup #1

## üéØ Core Philosophy

This meetup is about **practical knowledge exchange**, not presentations. Think of yourself as a guide sharing your map, not a professor giving a lecture. Your fellow attendees are experienced engineers - respect their expertise while sharing yours.

## üé§ Main Session Speakers (45-min slots)

### Cursor Deep Dive Session Guidelines

**Your Mission:** Show us how YOU use Cursor to ship actual code.

**Structure Your Session:**
1. **Quick Config Show (5 min)**
   - Screen share your settings.json
   - Explain your top 3 custom rules
   - Show your keyboard shortcuts

2. **Live Workflow Demo (25 min)**
   - Pick a real refactoring task
   - Show your process, including mistakes
   - Demonstrate multi-file operations
   - Include terminal integration if you use it

3. **Pattern Sharing (10 min)**
   - What patterns consistently work?
   - What breaks catastrophically?
   - Performance tips for large codebases

4. **Open Floor (5 min)**
   - Take questions
   - Get suggestions from audience
   - Exchange configs

**DO:**
- Show real code from actual projects (sanitized if needed)
- Include at least one failure story
- Pause for questions during demo
- Share your config files via GitHub gist

**DON'T:**
- Prepare polished slides about AI theory
- Use toy examples or "hello world"
- Hide when things go wrong (we learn from failures)
- Monopolize time - this is a discussion

### Claude Patterns Session Guidelines

2. **Pattern Demonstrations (25 min)**
   - Show 3-4 different prompt patterns
   - Include actual Claude conversations
   - Demonstrate iterative refinement
   - Show both successes and "hallucinations"

3. **Integration Workflow (10 min)**
   - How you move from Claude to IDE
   - Your verification process
   - Testing strategies for AI-generated code

4. **Interactive Challenge (5 min)**
   - Let audience suggest a coding task
   - Craft prompt together
   - Show real-time results

**Bring:**
- Screenshots of successful conversations
- Examples of prompt evolution
- Your prompt template/library if you have one
- Backup examples in case live demo fails

## ‚ö° Lightning Demo Presenters (5-min slots)

### The Rules
- **5 minutes max** - Timer will be visible
