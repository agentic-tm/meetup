## ðŸ’­ REMEMBER

This is the FIRST meetup. It won't be perfect. Focus on:
- Creating connections
- Sharing real knowledge
- Building momentum for next time
- Having fun with it

**Your only job**: Get developers in a room talking about agentic coding. Everything else is bonus.

**Worst case scenario**: 15 people show up, eat pizza, share some code, and have a good time. That's still a win.

**Best case scenario**: Packed room, amazing demos, community formed, people asking when's the next one.
