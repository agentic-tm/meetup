### Main Announcement (2 weeks before)

🤖 No speakers. No slides. Just 50 engineers with laptops open, sharing what actually works.

The first agentic.tm unconference is happening August 28th at CoworkGarden Timisoara. This is a knowledge swap meet for builders using Cursor, Claude, and other AI tools.

How it works:
✅ Bring your laptop with your ACTUAL setup
✅ Show us your config, we'll show you ours
✅ Live debugging of workflows that aren't working
✅ Copy-paste the best tricks directly from each other
✅ "My biggest AI coding fail" lightning talks

**The format:** Think mob programming meets show-and-tell. Everyone teaches, everyone learns. You'll leave with at least 5 new workflows you can use tomorrow.

Bring your laptop and your war stories. Show us your setup, we'll show you ours.

Limited to 50 spots. Free pizza, zero presentations.

### Reminder Post (1 week before)

Next Thursday: The meetup where everyone's a speaker.

No presentations. No "thought leaders." Just engineers with laptops, sharing real workflows.

What's happening:
🎯 Everyone brings their Cursor/Claude setup
🎯 Live config surgery - fix problems together
🎯 "Show me how you do X" exchanges
🎯 Open mic for anyone with something cool
🎯 Copy configs that work, debug ones that don't

## Email Newsletter Snippet

### Subject: Your AI writes code. Time to meet others who get it.

Hey builders,

Forget everything you know about tech meetups. No speakers. No presentations. No "thought leadership."

Just 50 engineers in a room with laptops open, sharing what actually works.

**August 28th, 18:30 at CoworkGarden Timisoara**

**The agentic.tm unconference format:**
- Bring your laptop with your ACTUAL Cursor/Claude setup
- Show your config, copy others' configs
- "How do you handle X?" becomes a group debugging session
- Got something cool? Open mic for 5-minute demos
- Stuck on something? The hive mind will solve it

**What you'll leave with:**
- At least 5 new workflows you can use tomorrow
- Config improvements that actually work
- Solutions to problems you've been struggling with
- A squad of engineers facing the same challenges

**Fair warning:** If you've discovered something interesting, you WILL be peer-pressured into showing it. Resistance is futile.

Space is limited to 50 humans. Bring your laptop and your war stories.

[RSVP on Lu.ma]

P.S. - "Show us your setup, we'll show you ours" is both the tagline and the entire agenda.
