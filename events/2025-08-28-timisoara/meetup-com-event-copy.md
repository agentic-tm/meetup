## Event Name
agentic.tm #1: Cursor, Claude, and the Art of Letting AI Write Your Code

## Event Description

### ü§ñ THE FIRST AGENTIC.TM MEETUP IS HERE

Are you letting AI agents write your code? Using Cursor like it's 2025? Having philosophical debates with Claude about variable naming? Perfect - you've found your people.

Join us on **Thursday, August 28th at 18:30** at CoworkGarden Timisoara for the inaugural agentic.tm meetup, where we'll share real experiences from the trenches of AI-assisted development.

### THIS IS NOT A CONFERENCE - IT'S A KNOWLEDGE SWAP MEET

Forget speakers and presentations. This is 50 engineers with laptops open, sharing what actually works.

**üéØ The Cursor Config Exchange**
- Everyone brings their setup, everyone shares
- Live config surgery - fix your completions on the spot
- "Here's what I changed and everything clicked" moments
- Copy-paste party for the best settings

**üéØ Claude Conversation Clinic**
- Bring your worst prompts, leave with better ones
- Watch others solve problems in real-time
- "Wait, you can do THAT?" discoveries
- Context window tricks discovered through painful experience

**üéØ Open Mic Lightning Rounds**
- Got something cool? You have 5 minutes
- No slides allowed - just show us your screen
- Failed experiments welcome (we learn from pain)

### üìÖ HOW THIS UNCONFERENCE WORKS

**18:30** - Setup your station, find your tribe
**18:45** - **Round 1: Cursor Config Battle** - Mob debugging of everyone's setups
**19:30** - Pizza break (trade secrets over slices)
**19:45** - **Round 2: Claude Conversation Clinic** - Live problem-solving with the crowd
**20:30** - **Open Mic Lightning Demos** - Got something cool? Show us!
**21:00** - **Pair Programming Hour** - Find someone with a different approach, learn it

### WHO SHOULD COME?

- Engineers ready to open their laptops and show their actual setup
- Developers who've discovered "that one weird trick" with AI coding
- Anyone who's built something real with Cursor/Claude
- Newcomers ready to skip months of trial and error
- Veterans willing to share their battle-tested workflows

**The only rule:** Bring your laptop and be ready to share. This is peer-to-peer learning at its finest. No experts, no beginners - just builders helping builders.

### MANDATORY GEAR

- **Your laptop** - This is non-negotiable. No laptop = spectator mode
- **Your ACTUAL working setup** - Not a demo, your real daily driver
- **That config file** you spent weeks perfecting
- **Problems you're stuck on** - The hive mind will help
- **Your proudest AI-assisted creation** - Time to show off
- **Willingness to share** - Knowledge hoarding not allowed
