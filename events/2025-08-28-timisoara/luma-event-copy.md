## Event Title
ü§ñ agentic.tm Meetup #1: Cursor, Claude, and the Art of Letting AI Write Your Code

## Short Description
The inaugural agentic.tm meetup where we share war stories from the frontlines of AI-powered development. From Cursor workflows to Claude conversations, discover how engineers are actually shipping code with autonomous agents.

## Full Event Description

ü§ñ **AGENTIC.TM MEETUP #1 - WHEN YOUR COPILOT BECOMES THE PILOT**

Join us on August 28th at CoworkGarden Timisoara, starting at 18:30, for an evening exploring the practical reality of agentic coding. We'll swap setups, share workflows, and debate whether our IDEs have become sentient. No hand-waving about AGI - just real engineers sharing what actually works (and what spectacularly doesn't).

Ever watched Claude refactor your entire codebase while you grab coffee? Spent hours crafting the perfect Cursor prompt only to get schooled by autocomplete? This is your tribe.

üóìÔ∏è **Event Format - Community Knowledge Exchange:**
‚úÖ 18:30-18:45 - Doors Open & Setup Stations (bring your laptop!)
‚úÖ 18:45-19:30 - **Cursor Config Battle Royale** - Show us your setup, we'll show you ours
‚úÖ 19:30-19:45 - Break & Refreshments üçï
‚úÖ 19:45-20:30 - **Claude Conversation Clinic** - Live problem-solving with everyone's workflows
‚úÖ 20:30-21:00 - **Open Mic Lightning Demos** ‚ö° (5-min slots, first-come-first-served)
‚úÖ 21:00-22:00 - Pair Programming & Setup Surgery üçª

**How It Works - Unconference Style:**
üéØ **Bring Your Laptop, Share Your Setup:**
- Live demonstrations from YOUR machine
- Real configs, real projects, real problems
- No slides, just live coding and screen sharing

üéØ **Collective Problem Solving:**
- Stuck on a Cursor config? Let's debug it together
- Claude ignoring your context? Someone here has the fix
- Found a killer workflow? Show it off

üéØ **Knowledge Marketplace:**
- Trade configs like Pok√©mon cards
- Copy-paste from each other's setups
- Form squads based on stack similarities

**Who Should Attend:**
- Engineers with Cursor/Claude setups to show off
- Developers with war stories from the AI coding trenches
- Anyone who's built something cool with AI assistance
- Builders ready to learn from collective experimentation
- Newcomers ready to leapfrog the learning curve

**What to Bring:**
- **Your laptop with your ACTUAL daily setup** (this is crucial!)
- **That one config file that changed everything**
- **Screenshots of AI wins/fails for the hall of fame**
- **Problems you want the hive mind to solve**
- **Your favorite prompt that always works**
- **Ego left at home - we're all learning here**

**The Format Revolution:**
No speakers. No presentations. No "thought leaders."

Just 50 engineers in a room, laptops open, sharing what actually works. Think of it as mob programming meets show-and-tell meets fight club for configs.

You'll leave with at least 5 new workflows, 3 config improvements, and 1 existential crisis about what programming means now.

**Fair Warning:** If you've discovered something cool, you WILL be peer-pressured into demoing it. Resistance is futile.

**Venue:** CoworkGarden Timisoara
**Date:** August 28th, 2025
**Time:** 18:30 - 22:00
**Price:** Free (your data remains your own)

Limited spots available. RSVP now before the agents claim them all.
