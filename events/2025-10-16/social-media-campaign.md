## 📢 POST 1: ANNOUNCEMENT (October 7)

### LinkedIn/Facebook

🤖 **AGENTIC.TM LAUNCHES IN TIMIȘOARA!**

Join us on October 16th at CoworkGarden, starting at 18:30, for an evening dedicated to agentic coding - where AI meets IDE and your code starts writing itself (almost).

We're bringing together developers who are actively using Cursor, Claude, and other AI coding tools to share real experiences, working setups, and the occasional horror story.

🗓️ **Event Details:**
📅 Thursday, October 16, 2025
⏰ 18:30 - 22:00
📍 CoworkGarden Timișoara
🍕 Pizza & drinks included

**Featured Speakers:**
🎤 Alexandru Binzar (CEO @ Hibyte) - "How to Never Write Code Again with Cursor"
🎤 Vlad Temian (Tech Lead @ The Sandbox) - "State of the Agentic Coding Ecosystem"

This isn't about hype or "the future of coding" - it's about what's working TODAY in your editor.

**Limited to 100 spots** - engineers who actually ship code with AI.

## 🎤 POST 2: FIRST SPEAKER REVEAL (October 10-11)

### LinkedIn/Facebook

🎯 **SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT: Alexandru Binzar**

Alexandru Binzar (CEO @ Hibyte) will be showing us how to configure Cursor so well that you literally don't have to write code anymore at our first agentic.tm meetup.

**What Alexandru Will Cover:**
• Complete Cursor setup walkthrough - from install to mastery
• Context management strategies that actually scale
• Live examples of going from idea to working code without typing
• The exact prompts and patterns he uses daily at Hibyte

As CEO of Hibyte, Alexandru has pushed the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted development, building entire features through conversation with Cursor.

This is the kind of practical knowledge sharing we're building at agentic.tm - real engineers, real workflows, real results.

## 🎤 POST 3: SECOND SPEAKER REVEAL (October 13-14)

### LinkedIn/Facebook

⚡ **SPEAKER #2: Vlad Temian**

Adding fire to our lineup: Vlad Temian (Tech Lead @ The Sandbox) joins us to map out the current state of the agentic coding ecosystem.

**What Vlad Will Cover:**
• The landscape: Cursor vs Windsurf vs Continue vs Copilot
• Tool selection: Which AI assistant for which task?
• Integration patterns that actually work in production
• The ecosystem gaps nobody talks about
• Where agentic coding is heading in the next 6 months

As Tech Lead at The Sandbox, Vlad has battle-tested every major AI coding tool while shipping Web3 infrastructure at scale.

Between Alexandru showing Cursor mastery and Vlad mapping the ecosystem, we're covering the full spectrum of agentic coding.
